# CodeCampFinder Client

Find a coding bootcamp that's right for you. Search for coding bootcamps and their associated course offerings based on your location and individualized criteria.

This repo is the front-end client, built in React. It is currently in maintenance mode and is in the process of being refactored.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to load dependencies

Run `npm test` to ensure a stable build

This is only the front end client, so to develop locally you'll need the backend server as well.

To get the backend up and running see [https://github.com/amgauthier1992/codecampfinder-api](https://github.com/amgauthier1992/codecampfinder-api)

Deployments are handled through Vercel (formerly known as Zeit) and can be run via `npm run deploy`
